David A. Embury gave a gimlet recipe (called a Gin Sour) in The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks (3rd Ed., 1958), calling for an 8:2:1 gin/lime (or lemon) juice/simple syrup ratio plus garnish. Eric Felten essentially repeated this recipe in his "How's Your Drink Column" in The Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition of August 4, 2006:
2 oz. gin or vodka
1/2 oz. lime juice
1/4 to 1/2 oz. simple syrup
Garnish with a lime
